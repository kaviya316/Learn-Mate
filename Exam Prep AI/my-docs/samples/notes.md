# Thermodynamics â€“ Summary

- Thermodynamics is the study of heat and energy transformations.  
- **System types**: Open, Closed, Isolated.  
- **First Law**: Î”U = Q - W (Energy conservation).  
- **Second Law**: Heat flows spontaneously from hot â†’ cold.  
- **Entropy**: A measure of disorder, always increases in natural processes.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Formulas
1. Î”U = Q - W  
2. PV = nRT  
3. Efficiency = Work out / Heat in  
4. Î”S â‰¥ 0 (irreversible process)  
5. Cp - Cv = R
